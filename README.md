# Exvia Audio Files Repository

This repository contains audio files used in the [Exvia Project](https://xabilitylab.ischool.illinois.edu/exvia-website/), an accessible Quarto-based website designed for blind and low-vision users to follow along with guided exercises.

## Purpose

These audio files are hosted on GitHub Pages so they can be streamed directly by the Exvia website. Each file corresponds to a specific exercise or instructional module.
